Please first generate a set of criterias for judging the task <the robot arm picks up a cup> as different rate categories: <Good, Average, Bad>. where: Bad: The task is not completed. Average: The task is partially completed, or you believe the transition is critical for achieving the goal, such as the target object appear in the agent's view, but falls short of completion.
